# Interactive Portfolio - Open World Adventure

Welcome to my interactive portfolio! This project is an immersive, open-world experience where you can explore different aspects of my work and achievements while navigating through a 3D world. Inspired by my love for **Valorant**, **gaming**, and my personality, this portfolio offers a fun and engaging way to explore my **projects**, **certifications**, and **about me**.

## Overview

This project transforms my portfolio into an interactive game where you can "explore" different areas by walking around a 3D world. Each area will reveal information about my **projects**, **certifications**, and **about me**. To make it even more fun, you'll collect "orbs" throughout the journey that link to different websites, such as my social media or project pages. 

### Key Features

1. **Interactive Open-World Navigation**
   - Walk around a 3D garden, room, and hall of fame to explore the different sections of my portfolio.
   - Each section contains interactive elements that allow you to discover more about me, my work, and my certifications.

2. **Orbs Collection Mechanism**
   - Collect "orbs" scattered throughout the world to view more detailed information about my **projects**, **certifications**, and **social profiles**.
   - Press "F" to collect orbs, which will open up the corresponding links (e.g., LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.) in new windows.

3. **Areas to Explore:**
   - **About Me**: A garden filled with logos of my social media profiles (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.). Collect orbs by interacting with the logos.
   - **Projects**: A room filled with hidden papers containing information about my past and current projects. Find these hidden papers and discover more about my work.
   - **Certifications**: A hall of fame with certificates hanging on the walls. Interact with these certificates to learn more about my achievements.

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: For 3D world rendering and object interactions.
- **HTML/CSS/JS**: For website structure, styling, and game mechanics.
- **Blender**: For creating 3D models and assets like social media logos, certificates, and papers.
- **GitHub Pages**: For hosting the interactive game and portfolio.

## How It Works

- **Movement**: Use the **WASD** keys to move around the world. Navigate through different areas (about me, projects, certs) by selecting the corresponding area.
- **Collecting Orbs**: Press **F** to collect orbs when you're close enough to an interactive element (like social media logos, certificates, or project papers).
- **Explore Areas**:
   - **About Me**: Walk around a garden where the logos of my social media profiles are displayed. Collect orbs to visit those pages.
   - **Projects**: Enter a room filled with hidden project papers. Walk around the room, find the papers, and discover more about the projects.
   - **Certifications**: Visit a hall of fame with framed certificates. Interact with the frames to learn about the certifications I've earned.
